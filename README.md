Description:
This is the early design for the pacman game
final project for the class ECE 4122. Default controls
are press 'R' for clockwise rotation. The math library was
also written by me as a utility. I never much liked the other
math libraries available such as glm, so I wrote my own so I could
define the notation that was more to my own liking. DEBUG_MODE
can be enabled for free camera movement mode.
DEBUG_MODE was used for the modelling of the maze.
